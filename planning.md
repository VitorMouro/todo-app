I want to implement a simple todo web app. Here a list of requirement I have:


- Use React

- Use NodeJS/Express

- Use Postgres

- Use Typescript

- Have user auth (Auth2.0 if possible)


What I want you to do for now is to plan this app. Without writing any code
just yet, just lay out as much details and information about the app as
possible, including architecture, other tools/technologies, pages, database
tables, etc. Then, write a detailed backlog of tasks.
